# Leaf-Lens
This is a Deep Learning Project
The problem addressed by the LeafLens project is
the challenge of early and accurate detection of
plant diseases, which often go unnoticed until they
significantly affect crop yield and quality.
Traditional methods of plant disease diagnosis are
time-consuming, labor-intensive, and may require
expert knowledge. This project secks to automate
the disease detection proces by using
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to
analyze leaf images, enabling rapid identification
of healthy versus diseased plants
